# Do Not Disturb Widget
A basic "Do Not Disturb" widget for [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org).

Simply import the widget and add it to your menu bar.
When you click the moon icon you'll toggle naughty notifications.

<sub>Note: I only started using Awesome WM very recently, there's probably a better plugin out there.</sub>
